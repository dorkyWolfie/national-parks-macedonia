# national-parks-macedonia

This is a website that contains all the important information about the national parks in my home country North Macedonia, while conserving good looks, easy access and great functionality.
It's written in HTML, styled with CSS and i gave it a bit of functionality with JavaScript. This project is in the group of firsts, so don't judge the code, i am still a newbie.

This project is the thesis for my BA in graphic design. So the copyright is shared with the AUE - FON Univerity and my great mentor.
